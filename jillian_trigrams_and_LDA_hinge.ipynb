I live in a major city in the U.S. Historically most matches I made would reply within 24 hours of my messages. Whenever I didn\\u2019t get a response within 24-36 hours it was usually because they ghosted the conversation.\\n\\nI recently matched with two guys (in their mid 30s) who both respond pretty slowly, taking 2+ days to respond. Multiple times I assumed they ghosted me, only to be surprised when they responded again continuing the conversation like normal. Their responses aren\\u2019t very long or detailed either. However eventually both guys asked me out on dates, but proposed times over a week away.\\n\\nObviously I can\\u2019t really know what\\u2019s going on in their heads or lives, but I\\u2019m assuming they aren\\u2019t that interested in me (maybe they have lots of options and I\\u2019m not high up on their \\u201clist\\u201d?). I haven\\u2019t gone on the dates yet. I\\u2019m not feeling terribly optimistic about them but will go for the plot at this point. However i was curious if anyone else has ever been in my position like this, or been the guy in this situation and could chime in. Thanks!\\n\\n\",\n          \"I'm in a small town and thinking about moving. I've been setting my location to the closet towns around and getting some matches. But I started to set my location to another town. Like some profiles. Then set it back to my current town. Will those people I liked see me if I'm outside their preferred distance? Or do I still get put in their stack even though I may be outside their filter distance now? Just wondering if I should leave it set to the city I liked ppl in for awhile before setting back to my own town?\\n\\n(I understand some people won't like this but I am serious about moving and work remote so it wouldn't be that difficult. Not just wasting people's time here) \",\n          \"I (32F) wanted to share this in case anyone else has experienced something similar\\u2014or can offer perspective I haven\\u2019t been able to find on my own.\\n\\nI recently went on three dates with a man (34M) I met on Hinge. Let\\u2019s call him Alex.\\nWe chatted for 2\\u20133 weeks before meeting, and it felt natural\\u2014fun, intelligent, emotionally open. On our first date, we kissed, talked for hours, and spent almost 8 hours together. There was genuine warmth I hadn\\u2019t felt in a long time. He even asked me a few times to come back to his place\\u2014but I said no.\\n\\nOur second date was a movie, and from the moment we met, I sensed he was distant. After the film, I gently asked if everything was okay. That\\u2019s when he shared that his ex had recently told him she was pregnant (not his child), and he admitted he was feeling deeply confused about it all. He said he hadn\\u2019t fully processed it, but also that he liked me and wanted to see me again when things felt a bit easier.\\n\\nAfter that date, I travelled for about a week and a half. During that time, he only reached out once. When I returned, I messaged him asking how he was\\u2014hoping to reconnect\\u2014but his replies were polite, not engaged. I took it as a sign that he\\u2019d lost interest. So I sent a short message: \\u201cHey, I really enjoyed our time together. I know things change, so just wanted to wish you all the best going forward.\\u201d I meant it as a gentle goodbye.\\n\\nThe next day, he replied warmly. He said that it\\u2019s rare to find a connection like ours and that he would definitely like to keep in touch and see me again\\u2014if I also wanted that. I agreed, and we met again.\\n\\nThe third date felt strange. Detached. We saw another movie, and afterward we went for a drink. He spoke mostly about his ex for two hours\\u2014how she still calls him every day, that she had stayed at the flat they used to live in together, and that during that time he had moved out for a few days and stayed with friends. He told me his therapist said he only dates beautiful women for validation, and that he might move abroad. He also said that maybe he\\u2019s not ready to date. At one point, I had to ask him to stop talking because I felt completely unseen.\\n\\nThe next day, I sent him a calm, clear message. I said I felt like a sounding board for his previous relationship, that I felt invisible, and that the connection between his messages and our in-person time didn\\u2019t match. I said I wasn\\u2019t blaming him, just needed to say it. He never replied.\\n\\nAnd then a few days later, I saw he had updated his Hinge profile\\u2014we\\u2019re still matched, which is how I noticed it.\\n\\nAnd here\\u2019s the part I can\\u2019t stop wondering about:\\nWhy didn\\u2019t he just take my gentle goodbye message and use that as his moment to step away, if he knew he wasn\\u2019t in the right headspace? Why did he say he wanted to keep in touch and see me again\\u2014only for our third date to feel so hollow, like he\\u2019d already checked out?\\nAnd why didn\\u2019t he reply to my last message, when all I did was express my experience honestly and without blame?\\n\\nNow I feel both rejected and invisible. And confused.\\nDid I read it wrong? Was it all about sex on the first date? Was I not attractive enough for him to continue seeing me?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"created\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2351950.609646009,\n        \"min\": 1737561286.0,\n        \"max\": 1745769639.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 998,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1742430214.0,\n          1739567945.0,\n          1744182328.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

We chatted for a few hours, she seemed very engaged and made some digs at me that I interpret as flirting. Next day we had a phone call for two hours that had pretty good energy. We have a surprising amount of things in common.\\n\\nI took her to a romantic dinner spot and we split a bottle of wine and stayed until closing. Then she asked to go to a bar for cocktails. I ended up kissing her there because it felt right, and we made out for a while. Then she wanted to go to another spot, and we made out there and hung out until closing.\\n\\nI drove her home after making out in the car a little bit. Texted her the next day and she agreed to meet up next week again. \\n\\nSo, I got out of an 8 year relationship a year ago and I still feel new to all this modern dating and hinge. I'm kind of worried about getting too emotionally invested too fast. What's the over under on she's into me as a potential partner vs she's into me as just a fun fling?

I can completely understand why, especially from a woman's perspective its not safe. I've heard some horror stories. \\n\\nI've also had a really good time on hinge both times I've been on here. Lots of good dates, some relationships, and I literally never ask for any personal information prior to a date unless it's explicitly offered to me. I don't feel that's held me back at all.\\n\\nSo I guess I'm just interested, particularly from a woman's perspective, do you like it when a man asks for your phone number etc before you've even met them?\",\n          \"I'm from Missouri.
